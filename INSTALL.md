# Building and Installation

## Quick Start

1. Use the provided defaults 
2. Build the library
3. Install the library
4. Include the library.

To complete steps 1-3 with one command try the following if your system supports `make`.

```zsh
make str_view [OPTIONAL/INSTALL/PATH]
```

This will use CMake and your default compiler to build and install the library in release mode. By default, this library does not touch your system paths and it is installed in the `install/` directory of this folder. This is best for testing the library out while pointing `cmake` to the install location. Then, deleting the `install/` folder deletes any trace of this library from your system.

Then, in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(str_view HINTS "~/path/to/str_view-v[VERSION]/install")
```

If you want to simply write the following command in your `CMakeLists.txt`,

```cmake
find_package(str_view)
```

specify that this library shall be installed to a location CMake recognizes by default. For example, my preferred location is as follows:

```zsh
make str_view ~/.local
```

Then the installation looks like this.

```txt
.local
├── include
│   └── str_view
│       └── str_view.h
└── lib
    ├── cmake
    │   └── str_view
    │       ├── str_viewConfig.cmake
    │       ├── str_viewConfigVersion.cmake
    │       ├── str_viewTargets.cmake
    │       └── str_viewTargets-release.cmake
    └── str_view
        └── libstr_view_release.a
```

Now to delete the library if needed, simply find all the `str_view` folders and delete them. You can also check the `build/install_manifest.txt` to confirm the locations of any files installed with this library.

## Include the Library

Once CMake can find the package, link against it and include the `str_view.h` header.

The `CMakeLists.txt` file.

```cmake
add_executable(my_exe my_exe.c)
target_link_libraries(my_exe str_view::str_view)
```

The C code.

```.c
#include "str_view/str_view.h"
```

### Alternative Builds

You may wish to use a different compiler and toolchain than what your system default specifies. Review the `CMakePrests.json` file for different compilers.

```zsh
make gcc-rel [OPTIONAL/INSTALL/PATH]
make install
```

Use Clang to compile the library.

```zsh
make clang-rel [OPTIONAL/INSTALL/PATH]
make install
```
## User Presets

If you do not like the default presets, create a `CMakeUserPresets.json` in this folder and place your preferred configuration in that file. Here is my preferred configuration to get you started. I like to use a newer gcc version than the default presets specify.

```json
{
    "version": 3,
    "cmakeMinimumRequired": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 21,
        "patch": 0
    },
    "configurePresets": [
        {
            "name": "gdeb",
            "displayName": "GMake GCC Debug",
            "description": "Generated by GMake with GCC base debug preset.",
            "generator": "Unix Makefiles",
            "inherits": [
                "gcc-deb"
            ],
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS": "ON",
                "CMAKE_C_STANDARD": "11",
                "CMAKE_C_COMPILER": "gcc-12",
                "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug",
                "CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY": "${sourceDir}/build/deb",
                "CMAKE_C_FLAGS": "-g3 -Wall -Wextra -Wfloat-equal -Wtype-limits -Wpointer-arith -Wshadow -Winit-self -fno-diagnostics-show-option -Wno-nonnull-compare -Wno-pointer-bool-conversion"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "grel",
            "displayName": "GMake GCC Release",
            "description": "Generated by GMake with GCC base release preset.",
            "generator": "Unix Makefiles",
            "inherits": [
                "gcc-rel"
            ],
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS": "ON",
                "CMAKE_C_STANDARD": "11",
                "CMAKE_C_COMPILER": "gcc-12",
                "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release",
                "CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY": "${sourceDir}/build/rel",
                "CMAKE_C_FLAGS": "-Wall -Wextra -Wfloat-equal -Wtype-limits -Wpointer-arith -Wshadow -Winit-self -fno-diagnostics-show-option -Wno-nonnull-compare -Wno-pointer-bool-conversion"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
